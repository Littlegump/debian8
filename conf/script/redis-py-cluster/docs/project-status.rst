Project status
==============

If you have a problem with the code or general questions about this lib, you can ping me inside the gitter channel that you can find here https://gitter.im/Grokzen/redis-py-cluster and i will help you out with problems or usage of this lib.

As of release `1.0.0` this project will be considered stable and usable in production. If you are going to use redis cluster in your project, you should read up on all documentation that you can find in the bottom of this Readme file. It will contain usage examples and descriptions of what is and what is not implemented. It will also describe how and why things work the way they do in this client.

On the topic about porting/moving this code into `redis-py` there is currently work over here https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/pull/604 that will bring cluster support based on this code. But my suggestion is that until that work is completed that you should use this lib.
